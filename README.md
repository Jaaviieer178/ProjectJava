## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project is built as a **monolithic application** using **Java**, **Spring Security**, **JWT**, and **Role-Based Access Control**. The decision to adopt a monolithic architecture was intentional, aiming to consolidate core features into a unified codebase and deeply integrate authentication and authorization. Although the system is already well-developed, there are still several areas for improvement, such as performance optimization, better modularization, and security refinement.

Looking ahead, there's potential to transition from this monolith to a **hybrid** architecture or even embrace **microservices**, depending on scalability needs and future domain complexity. This project serves as a solid foundation for both deep learning and structural evolution.
